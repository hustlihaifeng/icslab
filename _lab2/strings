That's number 2.  Keep going!
Halfway there!
Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
So you got that one.  Try this one.
Congratulations! You've (mostly) defused the bomb!
Hit Control-C to escape phase 6 (for free!), but if you want to
try phase 6 for extra credit, you can continue.  Just beware!
Science isn't about why, it's about why not?
Wow! You've defused the secret stage!
%d %c %d
So you think you can stop the bomb with ctrl-c, do you?

Curses, you've found the secret phase!
But finding it and solving it are quite different...
Congratulations! You've defused the bomb! Again!
Well...
OK. :-)
